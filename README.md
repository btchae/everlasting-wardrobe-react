# everlasting-wardrobe-react

This is a rough template of the current Everlasting Wardrobe site with React but no styling.

Important Notes:
-Sub Items only listed for jazz right now
-Express Yourself the only child component of How It Works
-Needs to be DRYer, still reading up on conditional component rendering.

npm start

Goals:
-Separate React components into different files for better readability
-Use conditional rendering to make this DRYer.
-Getting this to work with the Rails backend

Questions:
